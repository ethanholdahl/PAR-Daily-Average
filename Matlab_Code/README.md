These scripts reference matricies "lat.m" and "lon.m" which contain the index latitudes and longitudes for the input data.
Unfortunately both those matricies and the input data are too large to be uploaded to this repository. 
However, if you would like to run the scripts yourself the PAR data can be downloaded at http://www.glass.umd.edu/PAR/.
The data is provided in an integerized Sinusoidal (ISIN) projection at a 5km resolution. So you can use that to create your own lat and lon matricies.
If you are having trouble you can leave me a request or send me an email and I'd be happy to help.
