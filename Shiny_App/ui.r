                        to the rays. Since this is a constant that implies that there is a limit to the amount of radiation a square meter on earth receives and
                        that it changes throughout the day depending on the solar elevation angle. Consider the diagrams above, it is clear that a ray of width 1
                        (representing 1 solar constant) is projected to a length of x on the surface where \\(\\small x = \\frac {1}{\\sin(\\theta)}\\). So, it follows
                        that the maximal amount of radiation that a unit of area on the surface receives is \\(\\small \\frac {1}{x} = \\sin(elevation)\\). Of course,
                        we have an atmosphere, occasionally cloud cover and other obstacles which attenuate the amount of radiation that can reach the surface.
                        In this dataset we have observations every 3 hours. By dividing incident PAR by the theoretically maximum amount of PAR that could be
                        received at a given elevation angle (the amount that would be received if there was no atmosphere or obstructions) we can calculate exactly
                        what ratio of solar radiation that makes it to the surface. By calculating the ratio at each observation we have a measure of how much radiation
                        is being filtered out throughout the day. We can then linearly interpolate those ratio values between observations to get an estimate of PAR

                      calculated as incident value/sin(elevation angle). The weighted average being based on how close the unobserved incident is to the nearest values.
                      So if there exists 2 observations at times \\(\\small T_1\\) and \\(\\small T_2\\) with \\(\\small R_1\\) and \\(\\small R_2\\) as the respective ratios,

                      Since SunDecline and EqOfTime are approximately constant during a given day and since Lat and Lon don't change at a location, if we set 
                      
                      \\(\\small \\sin(Lat)*\\sin(SunDecline)=A, \\hspace{4pt} \\cos(Lat)*\\cos(Sundecline)=B,\\hspace{4pt}\\) and \\(\\small EqOfTime/4+Lon=C\\)
                      we get \\(\\hspace{4pt} \\small \\sin(elevation(t))=A-B*\\cos(t*360+C)\\) where \\(\\small A,B,C\\) are day and location specific constants.

                               You will notice that Wang et al.'s algorithm works great near the equator. However, the closer we get to the poles the more inaccurate Wang's
                               algorithms get (try moving latitude to -77 or so with the rest of the options in their defult settings). If we accept the PAR mechanics section
                               on this page and accept the idea of linearly interpolating the PAR ratios then Wang et al.'s algorithm can be replicated by assuming that solar
                               elevation is 0 degrees at sunrise and sunset and reaches 90 degrees at mid-day. However, as we get nearer to the poles this assumption becomes
                               less accurate. At the poles the solar elevation is effectively the same throughout the entire day. By interpolating using the assumption
                               inherent in Wang et al.'s algorithm we get InstPAR values that can exceed the theoretically maximum PAR value at that elevation, sometimes by
                               orders of magnitude. For this reason, I use my own, novel, ratio method which is robust to all latitudes, including locations where solar
                               elevation remains positive for the entire day, while remaining consistent with Wang et al.'s values in less extreme latitudes."),

                               the atmosphere perpendicularly. Under standard temperature and pressure conditions refraction only adjusts apparent solar elevation by about .6

                               as we have in this data set that means that every day we have observations that pick up positive PAR values before and after our calculated times
                               for sunrise and sunset respectively. If we do not account for this and blindly plug our values into one of the algorithms provided above then our
