# PAR-Daily-Average

I have made a shiny app, the code for which is in this repo, that explains the methods used to create a PAR data product and why they are an improvement over the previous methods. Please visit:
https://ethanholdahl.shinyapps.io/PAR_App/

The results of this method was used as a key input for “Humanity's Fundamental Environmental Limits” (Binder, Holdahl, Trinh and Smith, in prep). The code for the main model of the paper has its own [repository](https://github.com/binders1/maxpop) and the data for it, including this PAR data product is hosed on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Humanity_s_Fundamental_Environmental_Limits_--_model_input_files/9983369)
